Bayesian Thinking
underlies a self-driving car’s understanding of itself and the world around it, and to see the world the way a self-driving car does.

Working with Matrices
focus on two tools which are vital to self-driving car engineers: object oriented programming and linear algebra.

IMPLEMENT A MATRIX CLASS
C++ Basics
rewarding journey towards C++ expertise. The goal is translation: get a program written in Python, and translate it into C++.

TRANSLATE PYTHON TO C++
Performance Programming in C++
Explore how to write good code that runs correctly. focus primarily on low level features of C++,

Navigating Complex Data Structures
focus on frequently used data structures and algorithms.


Visualizing Calculus and Controls
basic calculus—the mathematics of continuity and use some of Python’s most popular visualization libraries.

Machine Learning and Computer Vision
I how a computer sees an image, and how can use machine learning to teach a computer to identify images
